Write K8s manifests to deploy cardano-node and cardano-db-sync. 
You can use testnet-preprod network. 

Cardano Node needs to be restored from mithril for fast bootstrapping. 

You should use pre-built binaries or Docker images as building from source can take a few hours.

Bonus point: Make them auto-scalable

Submission: Create a Github repo or gist containing the code and send the link to diepntb@minswap.org/ careers@minswap.org

You can discuss the solution with me via Telegram: @longminswap
